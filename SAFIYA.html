    <h2 style="color: #C2185B;"">SAFIA is the most beautiful and preteast girl <br>i have ever seen:</h2>
    <p >She is the purest soul I have ever known, a girl whose beauty isnâ€™t just in her face but in the way she loves,
        cares, and stays loyal. To me, she is the most beautiful girl in this entire worldâ€”not just because of her
        stunning smile and gentle eyes, but because of her heart that beats with kindness and truth. Every moment with
        her feels like a blessing, and I proudly say that I have found my peace, my happiness, and my forever in her.
    </p>
    <h2 style=" color: #C2185B;"> SAFIA is loyal for me :</h2>
    <p><b>SAFIA</b> is the true definition of loyalty. In every moment of my life, whether I was at my best or
        completely broken, she chose to stay by my side.<br> She never looked for perfection in me, instead, she loved
        me for who I am and supported me through everything.<br> Her loyalty isnâ€™t just in wordsâ€”it's in the way she
        cares, protects, understands, and stands with me even when no one else does.<br> Knowing that someone like her
        trusts me and stays loyal to me gives me strength and makes me feel like the luckiest person in this wor</p>
    <h3 style="color: #C2185B; font-size:30px ;">SAFIA love me more then her self:</h3>
    <p><b>SAFIA</b> loves me more than she loves herself, and I feel that in every little thing she does for me.<br> She
        puts my happiness above her own and cares for me in a way that makes me realize how rare and pure her love
        is.<br>
        Even when she is tired, she still checks on me, even when she is upset, she still chooses to stay, and even when
        things get difficult, she never gives up on us.<br> Her love is not just a feelingâ€”itâ€™s a sacrifice, a patience,
        and
        a silent promise that no matter what happens, she will always choose me first.</p>
